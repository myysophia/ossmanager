# OSS Manager Testing Guide

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for OSS Manager, including backend unit tests, frontend E2E tests, performance validation, and edge case handling.

## Overview

The testing suite validates:
- âœ… **Backend**: Unit tests for each proxy handler, including large file streaming
- âœ… **Frontend**: Cypress tests for navigation, upload, rename, delete scenarios  
- âœ… **Edge Cases**: Permission errors, expired tokens, network failures
- âœ… **Performance**: 1GB upload consumes <100MB RAM (stream copy validation)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run specific test suites
npm run test:backend      # Go unit & integration tests
npm run test:frontend     # Cypress E2E tests
npm run test:performance  # Memory usage validation
npm run test:e2e         # Specific E2E scenarios
npm run test:quick       # Essential tests only
```

## Test Structure

### Backend Tests

#### 1. WebDAV Proxy Handler Tests
**Location**: `internal/api/handlers/webdav_proxy_test.go`

Tests all WebDAV proxy endpoints:
- `ListDirectory` - Directory listing with pagination
- `UploadFile` - File upload with streaming support
- `DeleteFile` - Single and bulk file deletion
- `RenameFile` - File/directory renaming and moving
- `CreateDirectory` - Directory creation

Key features tested:
- Memory-efficient large file handling
- Concurrent upload scenarios
- Permission validation
- Error handling and recovery
- Network failure simulation

#### 2. Streaming File Tests  
**Location**: `internal/webdav/streaming_file_test.go`

Validates streaming implementation:
- Memory usage <100MB for 1GB uploads
- Chunked upload for large files
- Concurrent file handling
- Error recovery and cleanup
- Performance benchmarks

#### 3. Performance Tests
**Location**: `scripts/performance-test.go`

Memory validation tests:
- 50MB, 100MB, 500MB, 1GB file uploads
- Concurrent upload scenarios (5 x 100MB)
- Memory monitoring and reporting
- Throughput measurement

Example output:
```
=== Streaming Upload Performance Test ===

Test 1: Testing 50.0 MB file upload
Results:
  Duration: 2.34s
  Throughput: 21.4 MB/s
  Memory increase: 8.2 MB
  Peak memory: 45.6 MB
  Memory efficiency: 16.4% (lower is better)
  Success: true
  âœ… Memory usage within limits

Test 4: Testing 1.0 GB file upload
Results:
  Duration: 45.67s
  Throughput: 22.4 MB/s
  Memory increase: 52.1 MB
  Peak memory: 89.3 MB
  Memory efficiency: 5.1% (lower is better)  
  Success: true
  âœ… Memory usage within limits
```

### Frontend Tests

#### 1. File Explorer Navigation Tests
**Location**: `cypress/e2e/file-explorer.cy.ts`

Tests navigation functionality:
- Directory traversal and breadcrumbs
- File listing with pagination
- Search and filtering
- Empty state handling
- Performance with large directories

#### 2. File Upload Tests
**Location**: `cypress/e2e/file-upload.cy.ts`

Tests upload scenarios:
- Drag & drop single/multiple files
- Upload progress tracking
- Large file upload handling
- Upload cancellation
- Error handling and retry
- Network interruption recovery

#### 3. File Operations Tests  
**Location**: `cypress/e2e/file-operations.cy.ts`

Tests CRUD operations:
- File and folder rename
- Single and bulk delete
- Directory creation
- Move/copy operations
- Conflict resolution

#### 4. Error Handling Tests
**Location**: `cypress/e2e/error-handling.cy.ts`

Tests edge cases and error conditions:
- Expired authentication tokens
- Permission denied scenarios
- Network connection failures
- Storage quota exceeded
- Invalid file names and paths
- Browser compatibility issues

## Performance Validation

### Memory Usage Requirements

The key performance requirement is:
> **1GB file upload must consume <100MB RAM**

This is validated through:

1. **Streaming Implementation**: Files are processed in chunks, not loaded entirely into memory
2. **Memory Monitoring**: Real-time memory usage tracking during operations
3. **Garbage Collection**: Periodic cleanup to prevent memory leaks
4. **Concurrent Limits**: Controlled concurrent uploads to prevent memory overflow

### Benchmark Results

Expected performance characteristics:

| File Size | Memory Usage | Throughput | Success Criteria |
|-----------|--------------|------------|------------------|
| 50MB      | <20MB        | >15MB/s    | âœ… Pass          |
| 100MB     | <30MB        | >18MB/s    | âœ… Pass          |
| 500MB     | <60MB        | >20MB/s    | âœ… Pass          |
| 1GB       | <100MB       | >20MB/s    | âœ… Pass          |

## Edge Cases Covered

- Special characters in paths â†’ Proper encoding
- Deeply nested directories â†’ Path length limits
- Concurrent modifications â†’ Conflict resolution
- Storage quota exceeded â†’ Clear error messages

### Browser Compatibility
- Unsupported File API â†’ Fallback upload interface

- **Buckets**: Various sizes and permission configurations
- **Files**: Different sizes, types, and naming patterns
- **Errors**: Network failures, permission denials, quota exceeded

### Test Fixtures

```javascript
// cypress/fixtures/test-files.json
{
  "smallFile": {
    "name": "test-document.txt",
    "size": 1024,
    "content": "Sample content for testing"
  },
  "largeFile": {
    "name": "large-upload.bin", 
    "size": 104857600,
    "type": "binary"
  }
}
```

## Debugging Tests

### Backend Test Debugging

```bash
# Run single test with verbose output
go test -v ./internal/api/handlers -run TestWebDAVProxyHandler_UploadFile

# Debug with race detection
go test -race -v ./internal/webdav -run TestStreamingOSSFile

# Memory profiling
go test -memprofile=mem.prof -bench=BenchmarkStreamingUpload ./internal/webdav
go tool pprof mem.prof
```

### Frontend Test Debugging

```bash
# Run Cypress in headed mode
npm run cypress:open

# Debug specific test
npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/file-upload.cy.ts" --headed --no-exit

# Enable debug logs
DEBUG=cypress:* npx cypress run
```

## Coverage Reports

### Backend Coverage

Generated at `coverage.html` after running:
```bash
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./internal/...
go tool cover -html=coverage.out -o coverage.html
```

Target coverage: >80% for critical paths

### Frontend Coverage

Cypress code coverage configured via `@cypress/code-coverage`:
- Instruments code during build
- Collects coverage during test runs  
- Generates reports in `coverage/` directory

## Test Maintenance

### Adding New Tests

1. **Backend**: Create `*_test.go` files alongside source code
2. **Frontend**: Add `.cy.ts` files in appropriate `cypress/e2e/` subdirectory
3. **Update CI**: Ensure new tests are included in pipeline
4. **Documentation**: Update this guide with new test scenarios

### Test Data Cleanup

- Mock services automatically clean up after each test
- Temporary files are removed in `cleanup()` functions
- Database transactions are rolled back in integration tests
- Local storage is cleared between Cypress tests

## Performance Monitoring

### Memory Usage Alerts

Tests fail if memory usage exceeds:
- 100MB for 1GB file uploads
- 200MB for concurrent uploads (5 x 100MB)
- 50MB baseline increase for normal operations

### Performance Regression Detection

Benchmark tests track:
- Upload/download throughput
- Memory allocation patterns
- Database query performance
- API response times

### Monitoring Integration

Production monitoring should track the same metrics validated in tests:
- Memory usage per request
- Upload success rates
- Error recovery effectiveness
- Performance degradation
